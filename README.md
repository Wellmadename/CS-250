How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpeting user needs begins with understanding what is required when starting the project. Understanding what the team desires as well as getting
information from the user who is your main purpose is crutial. We start with developing with the mindset that were creating these programs and softwares
for the user that we think will be using them. Changes are welcome in agile and when working with the "Wants" of the user were inclined to change and 
tailor our creations to what they desire. Implementation is just going in and putting into motion the feedback we are reciving. Creating user stories gives
us the ability to lay out our To-Do list in a way and focus on what objectives need to be done. User stoires also give us an idea on what the end development
will resemble as we move forward.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Somthing this class helped me come to terms with is that it's adventagous to work on a program with multiple people because everyone can put a hand in the pot
to help where it's needed. Development of big programs arnt one man shows and the idea of a team atmosphere where everyone works together for a common end state
is somthing I look forward to. Another aspect of developing programs is to be precise and organized with what you're doing. An agile process that I hope to
incorporate into my future work would be utlizing the daily scrum into my team meetings at work and giving specific roles to individuals and setting up a space to
communicate daily. Having a open line of communication between all members of the team is crutial when working towards the same end goal. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Id like to think that being a team member is to fill in wherever you can and to bring somthing to the team that makes it better. No one likes to skim by and 
feel like they're not giving back to a team effort. I've always valued communication when working with teams because it leaves smaller margin for error. Being
on the same page as other people and leaving less up to interpretation makes for a smoother project as a whole.
